# on-repeat-spotify

I would automatically run this program every 5 days so that it could read my Spotify-generated On Repeat playlist and copy it into my own playlist. This kept a running history of what I listened to since the Spotify On Repeat would remove old songs to make room for new ones.  
This was the first time I had ever used an API.

# What I used

Python, Spotipy

# What I learned

-   First time using Spotify's API
-   Started learning about Python's style guide (PEP 8)
